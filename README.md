# Project-3_C-

* Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
My task is to build an item-tracking program for the Corner Grocer incorporating all requested functionality. In this project I used a combination of C++ and Python and linked them in order to create a seamless application that served the given requirements.

Requirements provided:
1. Produce a list of all items purchased in a given day along with the number of times each item was purchased.
2. Produce a number representing how many times a specific item was purchased in a given day.
3. Produce a text-based histogram listing all items purchased in a given day, along with a representation of the number of times each item was purchased.

* What did you do particularly well?
I was able to understand the requirements and address them all by adding to the provided code.

* Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I could probably refactor some of the code to make it more compact and easier to understand. I can also break the code down further to better organize and structure. 

* Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
The most challenging part for me had to be the integration as it was originally not working for me but I did some research and re-read the topic to increase my understanding and gave it another try which worked.

* What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
The skill of understanding requirements and using different languages to create a seamless product are skills that I will be able to use in the future.

* How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I tried to section parts into understandable pieces and included comments where needed to make the program maintainable, readable and adaptable.
